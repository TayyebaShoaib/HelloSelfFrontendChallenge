# HelloSelf Frontend Code Challenge
Thanks for your interest in joining the team at HelloSelf.

If you are successful then we'll invite you to our offices for a face-to-face interview and will use what you produce for this challenge as a starting point for our chat.

## The Task
This is a simple front-end code challenge created to give us a better understanding of your skills with HTML and CSS.

## Getting Started
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your fork to your development machine
3. Add Twitter Bootstrap to your project https://getbootstrap.com/
4. Add the [Mountains image](./images/mountains.svg) (SVG format) to `index.html` and centre it vertically and horizontally on the page
5. Make your first commit with commit message "Added mountains"

## The challenge
OK, now we are warmed up! Please remove the mountains image from your page. The following design needs to be coded up.

![Screen](images/screen.png?raw=true "The design we want you to code")

## Requirements
- Using HTML and CSS, create a pixel-perfect representation of part or all of the graphic above.
- On mobile: The box should take up full width of the viewport with a margin of 24px.
- On desktop: The box should be horizontally and vertically centred on the page and be no more than 540px in width.

## Top tips
It is OK if you don't finish this within an hour. __In fact, that's expected.__

The most important part of this challenge is that you can demonstrate:
- Pixel-perfect coding of part or all of the design
- An understanding of creating responsive web-pages
- An approach that is effective and efficient
- A tidy coding style

## Bonus points
1. Use a package manager to import Twitter Bootstrap
2. Use CSS flexbox as appropriate
3. You will notice at the top-right of the design above that there is an up-arrow: ![Arrow](images/arrow.png?raw=true "Arrow"). How would you hide part of the design when this is clicked?
